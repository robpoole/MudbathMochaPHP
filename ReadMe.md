# Mudbath Mocha

You can set up the entirety of this folder as a site to test it out for yourself, otherwise a copy of the codebase is currently hosted at http://mudbath.robpoole.co.uk/

I've built a UI with a page to show the outcomes of each step, and then a "Results" link that will run the logic and export the json in a new tab.

Most of the logic is in inc/functions.php, and the simplest version of running it is found in results.php.
